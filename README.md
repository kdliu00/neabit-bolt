## Near Orbit - Bolt
This repository contains an improved server-client version of Near Orbit. The original prototype can be found [here](https://github.com/kdliu00/neabit). This version used Photon Bolt under a server-authoritative multiplayer networking model. The `gamelift` branch contains an integration with Amazon GameLift, which handles matchmaking and hosts server instances. The project was discontinued as GameLift hosting costs proved too substantial and self-hosting proved unfeasible. Hopefully, this project can provide guidance for those who wish to integrate Photon Bolt and Amazon GameLift, or to simply use Amazon GameLift with Unity.

Built with [Unity](https://unity.com/).
