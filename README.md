# Near Orbit
The official repository for the Near Orbit project. Near Orbit aims to be a VR multiplayer game where players pilot spacejets with unique weaponry and abilities. The project uses the Oculus SDK to manage VR inputs, Photon Bolt to handle multiplayer networking, and AWS GameLift to handle matchmaking and server hosting. The networking is under a server-authoritative server-client model, where a server instance performs validation checks on in-game events and actions. This promotes consistency accross clients and mitigates server authority abuse as would be possible in a peer-to-peer model.
