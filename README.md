## Near Orbit - Bolt
This repository contains a server-client version of Near Orbit. The original prototype can be found [here](https://github.com/kdliu00/neabit). This version used Photon Bolt under a server-authoritative multiplayer networking model. The `gamelift` branch contains an integration with AWS GameLift, which handles matchmaking and manages server instances. The project was discontinued as AWS costs proved too substantial and local hosting proved unfeasible. Hopefully, this project can provide guidance for those who wish to integrate Photon Bolt and AWS GameLift, or to simply use AWS GameLift with Unity.

Built with [Unity](https://unity.com/).
